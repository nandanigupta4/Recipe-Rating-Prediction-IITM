## Introduction
 This project aims to classify recipes based on their ratings using a dataset from XYZ. Accurate classification of recipe ratings can help users find the best recipes quickly, improving their cooking experience.


## Dataset
The dataset contains 10,000+ recipes with features such as ingredients, cooking time, and user ratings.



## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.



## Model Training
We used several models including logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV.



## Evaluation
Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


## Results
The Stacking classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 77.8 on test data.


## Conclusion
The project successfully classified recipes based on ratings with reasonable accuracy. This can significantly aid users in selecting top-rated recipes.

## Future Work
Future work could involve exploring more advanced models and incorporating user reviews to enhance classification accuracy.
